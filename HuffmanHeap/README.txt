# description of files 

Program 3 - The 'main' program that everything is called from. Contains the main function and most importantly contains the  huffman algorithim. 

Heap : Contains the heap class and needed heap functions such as minheapify, insert, and delete that are used to implement huffman encoding. 


node: basic node constructor class. 

Analysis txt is the output file that we get displaying total bits, bits saved, and bits after the encoding.

Other .txt files are test cases. 




Issues and experience:

I spent the majority of my time on this project debugging. I knew something was wrong with my insert or delete, because after x amount of run throughs, my list would randomly get completely messed up. Eventually, it ended up just being an indexing issue in delete.
