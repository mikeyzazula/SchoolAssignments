1: 
Program 3 - The 'main' program that everything runs from. Has the main in it as well as huffmans algorithim. 
Heap : Has the heap class and all the needed heap functions such as mineapify, insert, and delete. 
node: basic constructor class. 

2: 
The main function that should be compiled is "main" in the Program3.java. 

3: I spent around 90% of my time working on this project debugging. I knew something was wrong with my insert or delete, because after x amount of run throughs, my list would randomly get completely messed up.
eventually, it ended up just being an indexing issue in delete. that was pretty depressing.
